I"H<p>Welcome to the <a href="https://dev.singularitynet.io">SingularityNET Developer Portal</a>.</p>

<p>Our Developer Portal provides documentation about the SingularityNET Platform and Marketplace. As a service developer, you will learn how to build and access AI services that are published onto the network. As a client of SingularityNET services, you learn to integrate your software with SingularityNET services that other people have published.</p>

<p>The beta Marketplace is online at <a href="http://beta.singularitynet.io">beta.singularitynet.io</a>, and allows you browse a curated set of services that are available in the registry.</p>

<p>If you’re new to SingularityNET, this is the suggested order in which to explore the developer portal. For everyone else, it’s hopefully a good index to find the information you need.</p>
