<p>Firstly, when a new update is available you have to download the files with the updated content from <a href="https://github.com/singnet/dev-portal">our Github</a>.</p>

<p>You can go ahead and build the site again locally as usual.</p>

<p>If you only want the theme updates, simply delete your old theme folder and replace it with the new one.</p>
