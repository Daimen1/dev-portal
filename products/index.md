The [SingularityNET Marketplace](http://beta.singularitynet.io) provides an interface for people to browse and interact with available AI services through web interface.


The [Request for AI Portal](https://rfai.singularitynet.io/) (RFAI) Allows user to request for AI services that are built and deployed onto the SingularityNET Network. Users can back requests with AGI tokens as a reward for having a service developed. The AGI tokens are transferred to the developer who submits a valid solution for the request. 


The [Publisher Portal](http://workinprogress) Helps people to assist the developers to publish and manage their organizations in a easier way.
and services using the publisher portal.

You can list your services in the marketplace (Dapp), which can help users to search and use your service.
***Publisher portal will be live by March***
