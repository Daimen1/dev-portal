## IPFS (Interplanetary File System)

The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a synthesis of several new and existing innovations. IPFS is an open-source project.

The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer network and a network protocol used to store and share data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. Organization details and service details are in IPFS and the associated hash is in a Blockchain.

The components of Inter-Planetary File system are:

Distributed Hash Tables
Block Exchanges
Merkle DAG
Version Control Systems
Self-certifying File System


For details on these components, see IPFS Documentation.
